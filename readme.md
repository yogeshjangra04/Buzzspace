## Introduction

Welcome to Buzzspace, my social network app.
This project was built as a side project, with the goal to sharpen my M.E.R.N. stack coding skills in mind.

I'm updating this app from time to time, adding features and fixing bugs.

This app was built with the following tools and technologies:

**Client**:

- React
- Redux
- CSS

**Server**:

- Node.js
- Express.js

**Database**:

- MongoDB
- Mongoose
